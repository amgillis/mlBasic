## Basic ML Pipeline

- This code base runs a basic machine learning pipeline with four elements: ETL, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation.
- To run the pipeline, execute main.py
- To configue that pipelines parameters, create a .yaml configuration file (e.g. config.yaml) and enter it's path in the CONFIG_PATH parameter in main.py.
- Logs are outputted to a 'logs' directory under root
- Any outputs such as csv files, figures are outputted to the 'outputs' directory under root
- Some rudimentary EDA is available in notebooks/eda.ipynb
